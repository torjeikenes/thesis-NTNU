\section{Previous work}

Before this thesis, the author wrote a specialization project report \cite{torjenygaardeikenesDesigningRISCVReference2023}. The chapters and sections listed below have been reused with varying resemblance to \cite{torjenygaardeikenesDesigningRISCVReference2023}. The findings from the report will be presented in \cref{sec:specialization}.


\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Introduction} \cref{Introduction} is based on the same chapter in \cite{torjenygaardeikenesDesigningRISCVReference2023}.
    \item \textbf{Background} \cref{sec:bg_pipeline} to \cref{sec:bg_cycle-accurate} is based on the same sections from \cite{torjenygaardeikenesDesigningRISCVReference2023}.
    \item \textbf{Previous work} The relevant findings from the report will be described in \cref{sec:specialization}.
\end{enumerate}
