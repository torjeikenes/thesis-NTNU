  abstract = {The technology of mechanized program verification can play a supporting role in many kinds of research projects in computer science, and related tools for formal proof-checking are seeing increasing adoption in mathematics and engineering. This book provides an introduction to the Coq software for writing and checking mathematical proofs. It takes a practical engineering focus throughout, emphasizing techniques that will help users to build, understand, and maintain large Coq developments and minimize the cost of code change over time. Two topics, rarely discussed elsewhere, are covered in detail: effective dependently typed programming (making productive use of a feature at the heart of the Coq system) and construction of domain-specific proof tactics. Almost every subject covered is also relevant to interactive computer theorem proving in general, not just program verification, demonstrated through examples of verified programs applied in many different sorts of formalizations. The book develops a unique automated proof style and applies it throughout; even experienced Coq users may benefit from reading about basic Coq concepts from this novel perspective. The book also offers a library of tactics, or programs that find proofs, designed for use with examples in the book. Readers will acquire the necessary skills to reimplement these tactics in other settings by the end of the book. All of the code appearing in the book is freely available online.},

With wider research directions and the increased number of simulators that have been developed, it becomes harder to choose a particular simulator to use. This paper reviews the fundamentals of different computer architecture simulation techniques. It also surveys many computer architecture simulators and classifies them into different groups based on their simulation models. Comparing computer architecture simulators with each other and validating their accuracy have been demanding tasks for architects. In addition to providing a survey of computer architecture simulation tools, we measured the experimental error of six contemporary computer architecture simulators: gem5, MARSSx86, Multi2Sim, PTLsim, Sniper, and ZSim. We also performed a detailed comparison of these simulators based on other features such as flexibility and micro-architectural details. We believe that this paper will be a very useful resource for the computer architecture community especially for early-stage computer architecture and systems researchers to gain exposure to the existing architecture simulation options.},

  abstract = {Architecture specifications notionally define the fundamental interface between hardware and software: the envelope of allowed behaviour for processor implementations, and the basic assumptions for software development and verification. But in practice, they are typically prose and pseudocode documents, not rigorous or executable artifacts, leaving software and verification on shaky ground.             In this paper, we present rigorous semantic models for the sequential behaviour of large parts of the mainstream ARMv8-A, RISC-V, and MIPS architectures, and the research CHERI-MIPS architecture, that are complete enough to boot operating systems, variously Linux, FreeBSD, or seL4. Our ARMv8-A models are automatically translated from authoritative ARM-internal definitions, and (in one variant) tested against the ARM Architecture Validation Suite.             We do this using a custom language for ISA semantics, Sail, with a lightweight dependent type system, that supports automatic generation of emulator code in C and OCaml, and automatic generation of proof-assistant definitions for Isabelle, HOL4, and (currently only for MIPS) Coq. We use the former for validation, and to assess specification coverage. To demonstrate the usability of the latter, we prove (in Isabelle) correctness of a purely functional characterisation of ARMv8-A address translation. We moreover integrate the RISC-V model into the RMEM tool for (user-mode) relaxed-memory concurrency exploration. We prove (on paper) the soundness of the core Sail type system.             We thereby take a big step towards making the architectural abstraction actually well-defined, establishing foundations for verification and reasoning.},

The model transformation is the most important artifact in MDE that it defines the automatic passing from one model to another. The validation of such model transformation are necessary to improve the safety of this latter, but most transformation languages have not a formal semantics to add detailed specifications on the expected behavior. So it is important to give solutions to integrate formal methods at this level. For this, we utilize the Coq proof assistant that is based on various calculus, for validating a model transformation specified with QVT-operational language.

State-of-the-art simulators using just-in-time (JIT) dynamic binary translation (DBT) techniques are able to simulate complex embedded processors at speeds above 500 MIPS. However, these functional ISS do not provide microarchitectural observability. In contrast, low-level cycle-accurate ISS are too slow to simulate full-scale applications, forcing developers to revert to FPGA-based simulations. In this paper we demonstrate that it is possible to run ultra-high speed cycle-accurate instruction set simulations surpassing FPGA-based simulation speeds. We extend the JIT DBT engine of our ISS and augment JIT generated code with a verified cycle-accurate processor model. Our approach can model any microarchitectural configuration, does not rely on prior profiling, instrumentation, or compilation, and works for all binaries targeting a state-of-the-art embedded processor implementing the ARCompact™ instruction set architecture (ISA). We achieve simulation speeds up to 63 MIPS on a standard {\texttimes}86 desktop computer, whilst the average cycle-count deviation is less than 1.5\% for the industry standard EEMBC and COREMARK benchmark suites.},

  abstract = {Digital applications complexity makes it harder every day to discover and debug behavioral inconsistencies at register transfer level (RTL). Aiming to bring a solution, several techniques have appeared as alternatives to verify that a circuit description meets the requirements of its corresponding functional specification. Simulation is widely applied due to its convenience to uncover early design bugs, but is far from providing the exhaustiveness acquired through formal methods, for which improved and new tools continue to appear. On the other hand, formal verification can suffer from problems such as state-space explosion or modeling inaccuracy. Then, it is vital to develop new ways to check a design for consistency fast and comprehensively. In this paper, we propose a sequential equivalence checking (SEC) formalism and an algorith m, for use between a specification, written at electronic system level (ESL), and an implementation, written at RTL. Given that equivalence is checked between different levels of abstraction, it is no longer valid to perform SEC on single states, thus, we show a scheme to extract and compare complete sequences of states in order to determine if the design intention, which is described in the ESL specification, is contained and respected by the RTL implementation. The results obtained suggest that our methodology can be applied efficiently on real designs.},

The kernel is an untimed but high-speed instruction set simulator (ISS) and is suitable for software development; while the timing shell provides additional timing details for cycle-accurate hardware behavior. When a new processor member is added to the family, it demands only a new timing shell because the kernel is identical to that of its ancestors sharing the same instruction set architecture (ISA). It not only helps ensure functional consistency but significantly reduces the model development time. We take two processors with a same ISA, an ARM7-like one and an ARM9-like one, as our modeling examples to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technique. Finally, the experimental results show that, on average our two-layered cycle-accurate model is about 30 times faster than the RTL model in simulation.},

Even though most state-of-the-art commercial tools have tried very hard to provide all the levels of details to satisfy the different requirements of the software designer, the hardware designer, and even the system architect, the hardware/software co-simulation speed is dramatically slow when co-simulating the hardware models at the register-transfer level (RTL) with a full-fledged operating system (OS). Our experimental results show that the combination of QEMU and SystemC can make the co-simulation at the CA level much faster than the conventional RTL simulation, even with a full-fledged operating system up and running. Furthermore, the statistics indicate that with every instruction executed and every memory accessed since power-on traced at the CA level, it takes 28m15.804s on average to boot up a full-fledged Linux kernel, even on a personal computer. Compared to the kernel boot time reported by Xilinx and SiCortex, the proposed CA-ISS is about 6.09 times faster compared to ``SystemC without trace'' of Xilinx and about 30.32 times faster compared to ``SystemC models converted from RTL'' of SiCortex. The main contributions of this paper are threefold: 1) a hardware/software co-simulation environment capable of running a full-fledged OS at the early stage of the electronic system level design flow at an acceptable simulation speed is proposed; 2) a virtual platform constructed using the proposed CA-ISS as the processor model can be used to estimate the performance of a target system from system perspective, which all the previous works, such as QEMU-SystemC, do not provide; and 3) such a virtual platform also provides the modeling capability from the transaction level down to the CA level or the other way around.},

With the increase in distribution of RISCV processors, security issues in them arise. Security vulnerabilities and design flaws in processors can be exploited by attackers, e.g. by running software exploiting the vulnerabilities. This can lead to drastic consequences like damaging whole system functionality and even human lives can be endangered. Hence, it is very important to verify compliance of processors with the design specification and microarchitecture intent to harden the hardware against malicious attacks. Detection and removal of design bugs results in improved processor security. Therefore, we formally verify in this paper the security-critical functionality of a commercial RISC-V processor using model checking based formal verification with the formal verification tool Jasper. For this, we determined and implemented a comprehensive list of properties for security-critical functionality, derived from RISC-V specification and processor microarchitecture intent. The properties cover the security-critical functionality within a RISC-V processor. With our verification experiments, we detected design bugs which have been confirmed by the design team.},

  abstract = {Verification has long been recognized as an integral part of the hardware design process. When designing a system, engineers usually use various design representations and concretize them step by step up to a physical layout. At the beginning of the process, when there is much of indeterminacy, only abstract reference models are applicable to verification; when the process is close to the end, more concrete ones can be utilized. The article concerns problems of developing reusable verification systems (testbenches), which can be used to analyze different versions of the same component at different abstraction levels. We suggest an approach to construct reusable reaction checkers basing on a concept of Transaction Level Modeling (TLM). The paper includes general description of the approach, considers several particular cases, and outlines our experience.},

  abstract = {Dynamic binary translation has a history of being used to ease transitions between CPU architectures[7], including micro-architectures. Modern x86 CPUs, while maintaining binary compatibility with their legacy CISC instruction set, have internal micro-architectures that resemble RISC. High performance x86 micro-architectures have long used a CISC decoder front-end to crack complex instructions into smaller micro-operations. Recently macro-op fusion [17][6] has been used to combine several instructions into one micro-op. Both techniques change the shape of the ISA to match the internal {\textmu}op micro-architecture. Well-known binary translators also use micro-op internal representations to provide an indirection between the source and target ISAs as this makes the addition of new instruction sets much easier.},

  abstract = {The instruction set architecture (ISA) specifies a contract between hardware and software; it covers all possible operations that have to be performed by a processor, regardless of the implemented architecture. Verifying the instruction execution against a golden execution model following the ISA is becoming a common practice to verify processors. Despite many potential applications, existing verification frameworks require an extensive test set to cover most of the processor states. In this paper, we suggest a verification scheme combining two different domains, simulation- and formal-verification, establishing a methodology for exclusive error detection. The first approach drives automatic program generation using genetic algorithms to maximize coverage of the test and the contrast against an instruction set simulator. The second is a formal verification approach, where an interface carries specific processor states according to the ISA specification. By combining these two, we present a reliable way to perform more accurate instruction verification by increasing processor state coverage and formal assertions to detect different kinds of errors. Compared to extensive torture test sets, this approach reaches a more significant number of internal states by taking advantage of the exercised abstractions. Among remarkable results to highlight, the proposed approach detected a RISC-V ISA specification gap revealing ambiguity from two different verification perspectives.},

The proposed scheduling algorithm is based on the unique RISC-V ISA that enables decoding of the instruction type in an early stage of the pipeline. The RISC-V-based multithreading architecture is evaluated using a dedicated software simulator. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the classical Round Robin and the coarse grain algorithms. The proposed architecture is evaluated using the standard MiBench benchmark and other common applications, demonstrating pipeline utilization improvement of up to about 26\% in terms of IPC using four threads.},

We have experimented our proposal using processors models provided by the QEMU framework to replace the existing ISSes and SystemC TLM as simulation environment for the whole platform.

Register-transfer level (RTL) simulators or systems such as gem5 [4] are used to execute programs in a cycle-accurate manner but are often prohibitively slow. In contrast, functional simulators such as QEMU [2] can run large benchmarks to completion in a reasonable time yet capture few performance metrics and fail to model complex interactions between multiple cores. This paper presents a novel multi-purpose simulator that exploits binary translation to offer fast cycle-level full-system simulations. Its functional simulation mode outperforms QEMU and, if desired, it is possible to switch between functional and timing modes at run-time. Cycle-level simulations of RISC-V multi-core processors are possible at more than 20 MIPS, a useful middle ground in terms of accuracy and performance with simulation speeds nearly 100 times those of more detailed cycleaccurate models.},

We show that, through the use of sporadic activation of processes and simulation of nondeterminism by the way of auxiliary inputs, the synchronous paradigm allows a precise control of asynchrony.

  abstract = {The RISC-V ISA and ecosystem have been becoming an increasingly popular in both industry and academia. gem5 is a widely used powerful simulation platform for computer architecture research. Previous works have added single-core and multi-core RISC-V support to gem5 but only for system call emulation. The full-system simulation of gem5, on the other hand, provides accurate analysis of systems as an actual system software is loaded and run on the hardware platform modelled in gem5. However, full-system simulation support in gem5 for RISC-V ISA is currently not available. This paper presents our recent work on supporting RISC-V fullsystem simulation in gem5. After describing the implementation details of supporting extensible target system and debugging methodology for overcoming major challenges, we share our experiments of full-system simulations.},

  abstract = {The xMAS micro-architecture modeling language has been introduced by Intel to facilitate the formal representation and analysis of on-chip interconnect fabrics. In this paper, we introduce xMAStime, a new domain-specific language inspired by xMAS. xMAStime allows the modeling of full micro-architectures comprising certain classes of CPU pipelines, caches, and RAM. Given an in-order pipeline model in xMAStime, we automatically generate both a Cycle-Accurate, Bit-Accurate (CABA) hardware simulator and a timed instruction set simulator where time is accounted with safe upper bounds, as in the pipeline analysis step of Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) analysis. The approach relies on the theory of endochronous systems, which allows us to ensure functional equivalence and timing consistency between the two generated simulators, using a delay-insensitivity argument. xMAStime is implemented over Lucid Synchrone -- a dataflow synchronous language featuring a higher order type system and type inference, which facilitate the definition of our DSL. We use the new DSL to model and synthesize simulation code for a full-fledged MIPS32-based architecture.},

The paper presents an overview of approaches used for multi-core microprocessors interrupt system with virtualization support verification. Some definitions and characteristics of interrupt systems that needed to be taken into account in the process of verification are described. Stand-alone verification environment general scheme is presented. Universal Verification Methodology was applied to construct test system. To simplify development of checking module discrete-event with time accounting reference model was used. Sequences of primary requests and automatically generated secondary requests in the special modules named auto-handlers were used for test system behavior randomization. We describe some difficulties discovered in the verification process and corresponding solving methods. Generalized test algorithm stages are presented. Some other techniques for checking the correctness of interrupt system have been reviewed. In conclusion, we provide the case study of applying the suggested approaches for interrupt system verification of microprocessors with ``Elbrus'' and ``SPARC-V9'' architectures developed by MCST.

  abstract = {There have been strong demands for a fast and cycle-accurate virtual platforms in the embedded systems area where developers can do meaningful software development including performance debugging in the context of the entire platform. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a fast and cycle-accurate architecture simulator called FaCSim as a first step towards such a virtual platform. FacSim accurately models the ARM9E-S processor core and ARM926EJ-S processor's memory subsystem. It accurately simulates exceptions and interrupts to enable whole-system simulation including the OS. Since it is implemented in a modular manner in C++, it can be easily extended with other system components by subclassing or adding new classes. FaCSim is based on an interpretive simulation technique to provide flexibility, yet achieving high speed. It enables fast cycle-accurate architecture simulation by means of three mechanisms. First, it computes elapsed cycles in each pipeline stage as a chunk and incrementally adds it up to advance the core clock instead of performing cycle-by-cycle simulation. Second, it uses a basic-block cache that caches decoded instructions at the basic-block level. Finally, it is parallelized to exploit multicore systems that are available everywhere these days. Using 21 applications from the EEMBC benchmark suite, FaCSim's accuracy is validated against the ARM926EJ-S development board from ARM, and is accurate in a {\textpm}7\% error margin. Due to basic-block level caching and parallelization, FaCSim is, on average, more than three times faster than ARMulator and more than six times faster than SimpleScalar.},

This simulation infrastructure allows researchers to model modern computer hardware at the cycle level, and it has enough fidelity to boot unmodified Linux-based operating systems and run full applications for multiple architectures including x86, Arm{\textregistered}, and RISC-V. The gem5 simulator has been under active development over the last nine years since the original gem5 release. In this time, there have been over 7000 commits to the codebase from over 250 unique contributors which have improved the simulator by adding new features, fixing bugs, and increasing the code quality. In this paper, we give an overview of gem5's usage and features, describe the current state of the gem5 simulator, and enumerate the major changes since the initial release of gem5. We also discuss how the gem5 simulator has transitioned to a formal governance model to enable continued improvement and community support for the next 20 years of computer architecture research.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new Property-Driven Design (PDD) method that starts from an abstract system model and integrates formal property checking early into a top-down design methodology for register transfer level (RTL) hardware. In PDD the role of formal verification is not limited to ``bug hunting'' alone. Instead, the formal techniques are applied in such a way that a formal relationship is provided between the abstract system model and its concrete implementation at the RTL. In order to avoid the high efforts associated with verification by property checking the proposed PDD approach automatically generates abstract properties from a system-level description and later refines them along the design process. The advantage of this methodology is to obtain a formally verified design at lower costs when compared to conventional design flows with property checking. The main benefit of the proposed approach results from the fact that a formally sound system model is available together with the RTL design. Specifically, LTL properties proven on the abstract model also hold on the concrete implementation. This facilitates many complex analysis and verification tasks in today's design flows and contributes to emancipating system-level models from prototypes to golden design models. Several open-source and industrial case studies are reported that demonstrate the high potential of a PDD-based design paradigm.},

ETISS-ML achieves close-to-RTL-accurate fault injection simulation results with close-to-ISS simulation performance with a speed up gain up to 100x compared to RTL. For this, we propose an approach to dynamically determine the length of the RTL simulation period. The high simulation performance of ETISS-ML enables an ultra-efficient and accurate evaluation of cross-layer resiliency techniques for embedded applications, which requires running a large number of fault injections for long simulation scenarios. This is demonstrated on a case study of a Microcontroller Unit (MCU) executing a control algorithm for adaptive cruise control.},

We address this by validating a full system-level simulator, gXR5 (gem5-eXtensions for RISC-V), against the SiFive HiFive Unleashed SoC, to ensure performance statistics are representative of actual hardware. This work also enriches existing methodologies to validate the gXR5 simulator against hardware by proposing a systematic component-level calibration approach. The simulator error for selected SPEC CPU2017 applications reduces from 44\% to 24\%, just by calibrating the CPU. We show that this systematic component-level calibration approach is accurate, fast (in terms of simulation time), and generic enough to drive future validation efforts.},

  abstract = {Software simulation is of a big importance during development of processors as they provide access to hardware under development. Cycle-accurate simulators allow software engineers to design and optimize high-performance algorithms and programs with considerations of features and characteristics of processors being in development. This is especially important for architectures, whose performance is mainly achieved by advanced compiler optimizations. One of the core aspects of a cycle-accurate simulator is the way it simulates the pipeline of the target processor. A pipeline model has high impact on an overall structure of a simulator and its potential performance and accuracy. The main goal of this paper is to develop and analyze different approaches to pipeline simulation of ``Elbrus'' microprocessors, which let us reuse functionality of existing instruction set simulator and achieve good balance of performance and accuracy. We briefly describe features of ``Elbrus'' microprocessors and specifics of existing instruction set simulator, relevant for cycle-accurate simulation. We make several simple, but general and useful observations about various aspects of pipeline behavior in context of accurate and efficient cycle-accurate simulation of microprocessors. These observations are then used as a basis for justification, development and analysis of the several approaches to the pipeline simulation, described in this paper. We describe four different approaches, starting from simple and obvious one, which is then successively transformed into more advanced ones through several iterations. We analyze limitations of proposed approaches and outline further work.},

Due to increasing complexity of the architectures and timeto-market pressure, performance is the most important feature of an instruction-set simulator. Interpretive simulators are flexible but slow, whereas compiled simulators deliver speed at the cost of flexibility. This paper presents a novel technique for generation of fast instruction-set simulators that combines the benefit of both compiled and interpretive simulation. We achieve fast instruction accurate simulation through two mechanisms. First, we move the timeconsuming decoding process from run-time to compile time while maintaining the flexibility of the interpretive simulation. Second, we use a novel instruction abstraction technique to generate aggressively optimized decoded instructions that further improves simulation performance. Our instruction set compiled simulation (IS-CS) technique delivers upto 40\% performance improvement over the best known published result that has the flexibility of interpretive simulation. We illustrate the applicability of the IS-CS technique using the ARM7 embedded processor.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen great advances towards verifying large-scale systems code. However, these verifications are usually based on hand-written assembly or machine-code semantics for the underlying architecture that only cover a small part of the instruction set architecture (ISA). In contrast, other recent work has used Sail to establish formal models for large real-world architectures, including Armv8A and RISC-V, that are comprehensive (complete enough to boot an operating system or hypervisor) and authoritative (automatically derived from the Arm internal model and validated against the Arm validation suite, and adopted as the official formal specification by RISC-V International, respectively). But the scale and complexity of these models makes them challenging to use as a basis for verification. In this paper, we propose Islaris, the first system to support verification of machine code above these complete and authoritative real-world ISA specifications. Islaris uses a novel combination of SMT-solver-based symbolic execution (the Isla symbolic executor) and automated reasoning in a foundational program logic (a new separation logic we derive using Iris in Coq). We show that this approach can handle Armv8-A and RISC-V machine code exercising a wide range of systems features, including installing and calling exception vectors, code parametric on a relocation address offset (from the production pKVM hypervisor); unaligned access faults; memory-mapped IO; and compiled C code using inline assembly and function pointers.},

Many product innovations are based on software and thus the complexity of software, even when running on platforms equipped with small microprocessors, is increasing dramatically. This calls for adequate embedded software integration testing, even before the actual hardware platform is available. The application of virtual platforms for functional validation, that allows simulating CPS running real target platform application code on a generic host computer, is currently being adopted by the industry. Since the correct behavior of a CPS not only depends on the correctness of computation but also on its timeliness, virtual platforms contain a certain notion of time. This work focuses on enhancing OVP processor models by a quasi-cycle accurate timing model. This paper demonstrates and evaluates the accuracy of the proposed timing model against real hardware measurements for the Xilinx MicroBlaze and ARM Cortex-M0 processors. Results show a mean error of 0.16\% for the MicroBlaze and 0.72\% for the ARM Cortex-M0 processor over all considered benchmarks, which is a clear improvement compared to previous published work.},

  abstract = {Instruction set simulators (ISS) have many uses in embedded software and hardware development and are typically based on dynamic binary translation (DBT), where frequently executed regions of guest instructions are compiled into host instructions using a just-in-time (JIT) compiler. Full-system simulation, which necessitates handling of asynchronous interrupts from e.g. timers and I/O devices, complicates matters as control flow is interrupted unpredictably and diverted from the current region of code. In this paper we present a novel scheme for handling of asynchronous interrupts, which integrates seamlessly into a region-based dynamic binary translator. We first show that our scheme is correct, i.e. interrupt handling is not deferred indefinitely, even in the presence of code regions comprising control flow loops. We demonstrate that our new interrupt handling scheme is efficient as we minimise the number of inserted checks. Interrupt handlers are also presented to the JIT compiler and compiled to native code, further enhancing the performance of our system. We have evaluated our scheme in an ARM simulator using a region-based JIT compilation strategy. We demonstrate that our solution reduces the number of dynamic interrupt checks by 73\%, reduces interrupt service latency by 26\% and improves throughput of an I/O bound workload by 7\%, over traditional per-block schemes.},

  abstract = {As real-time applications become increasingly demanding, complex CPU architectural techniques like Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) and Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) are the new norm. Processors have evolved along a similar trajectory to include twice the number of instructions compared to its predecessor, the ability to fetch a larger instruction packet and execute multiple instructions simultaneously. To ensure that the design meets the specification it's imperative to verify every possible operand combination as well as sequencing of instructions. This demands deployment of novel techniques which can reduce verification effort without compromising on the quality. In this paper, we propose a Formal Verification (FV) based ``divide-and-conquer'' approach to CPU verification which utilizes executable specification. We propose dividing the verification effort into two levels of design abstraction, namely basic functional unit level (e.g. Adder (ADD), Multiply and Accumulate (MAC), etc.) and module level (e.g. collection of functional units like ALU). FV allows us to cover the vast state space while avoiding the burden of developing corresponding stimulus. By automating the verification flow from an executable specification, we eliminate the possibility of human error and standardize the setup across functional units. We leverage these techniques to accomplish comprehensive verification goals and achieve design sign-off. When implemented, we were able to achieve 50\% reduction in the CPU verification effort and identify corner case bugs that would have been impossible to find using Dynamic Verification.},

The ecosystem provides rich open-source software and hardware tool chains that enable computer architects to quickly leverage RISC-V in their research. While the RISC-V ecosystem includes functional-level, register-transferlevel, and FPGA simulation platforms, there is currently a lack of cycle-level simulation platforms for early design-space exploration. gem5 is a popular cycle-level simulation platform that provides reasonably flexible, fast, and accurate simulations. Previous work has added single-core RISC-V support to gem5. This paper presents our recent work on simulating multi-core RISC-V systems in gem5. We first describe our approach to functional and timing validation of RISC-V systems in gem5. We then evaluate the performance of the gem5/RISC-V simulator and discuss a design-space-exploration case study using gem5, the open-source RISC-V software tool chain, and two popular task-based parallel programming frameworks.},

  abstract = {Formal techniques for the functional verification of System-on-Chip (SoC) hardware have matured significantly over the last years. They can penetrate deeply into a design to exhibit complex functional dependencies between various design components in terms of detailed logical and temporal relationships. They can also provide a well-defined formal relationship between an abstract system model of a design and its concrete implementation at the register-transfer level (RTL). This paper shows how such knowledge available from formal verification can be ``condensed'' into a database that stores all registers and flip-flops, at which time points they are actually relevant for the correct behavior of the design and when they are not. We show that the comprehensive information on temporary unobservabilities in the design can be of great value to reach two nonfunctional design goals that play a dominant role in many design flows: safety and low power consumption. This paper presents techniques to assess the effects of soft errors by single-event upsets (SEUs) with formal precision and to relate the results of the proposed analysis to an abstract system model. For example, our analysis can determine which soft errors may lead to a system ``crash'' and which are guaranteed not to cause any harm. For the application of the proposed approach in power optimization, this paper presents techniques for clock gating and power gating. For the examined designs, we observe a reduction of power consumption between 10\% and 50\% on top of the state-of-the-art commercial power synthesis.},

In order to achieve accurate simulation results of MCISS, a lock-step approach, which synchronizes every cycle, is commonly used. However, this approach introduces immense overhead and lowers the simulation speed. Instead of synchronizing every cycle, our approach synchronizes the MCISS based on the data dependency among the simulated programs. Therefore, the synchronization overheads can be highly reduced while the accurate simulation results are ensured. With the proposed approach applied, the simulation speed of MCISS is up to 40 {\textasciitilde} 1,000 million instructions per second (MIPS) in general.},

  abstract = {Stringent power budgets in battery powered platforms have led to the development of energy saving techniques such as Dynamic Voltage and Frequency scaling (DVFS). For embedded system designers to be able to ripe the benefits of these techniques, support for efficient design space exploration must be available in system level simulators. The advent of the edge computing paradigm, with power constraints in the mW domain, has rendered this even more essential. Without a fast and accurate methodology for architecture simulation and energy estimation, the benefit of new ideas and solutions cannot be evaluated. In this paper, we propose a non-intrusive application controlled DVFS management implementation in the GEM5 simulator, used with GEM5's system call emulation mode. We also propose a novel architecture independent energy model based on categorization of different measurable workload classes. Our energy model is parametrized and calibrated with power measurements on a SAM4L microcontroller board, containing an ARM Cortex M4 processor. Together with the GEM5 output statistics, the model accurately estimates the total energy consumption of our simulated system. The results from our modified GEM5 simulator are validated with representative signal processing applications. After correction of systematic offset errors, our results deviate with less than 4\% compared to measurements from the SAM4L microcontroller. Our contributions in this paper can easily be tailored to other processor models in GEM5 and to future versions of GEM5. It will therefore enable system architects to explore new techniques and compare the improvements relative to existing architectures.},
